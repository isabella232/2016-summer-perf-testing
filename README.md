This is a repo for collaborating between members of the Open MPI
community in the summer 2016 performance testing / tuning effort.

Make a directory for your results and put them in there.  We'll figure
out a reasonable directory structure / etc. as we go.  :-)

The performance discussion is located in Issues tab. There we have awesome Github commenting/referencing system to collaborate.
